            Artificial Intelligence is one of the biggest technological advances
            in recent years, underpinning development such as self-driving cars,
            image generation and ChatGPT! Whether you're a machine learning expert
            or just getting started, this Summit will give you the opportunity to
            learn about AI's industry applications, get hands-on with cutting-edge
            models and discuss the safety implications of superintelligent machines!
            There will also be plenty of opportunities to network and make connections.

            <br />
            <br />

            This event will take place in the FAB on the 8th and 9th February, with
            talks, workshops and discussion panels happening from 10:30am to 5pm, with
            our Summit VIP Networking Drinks taking place in the Chancellors Suite in
            the evening on the 8th! A free standard ticket will give you access to all
            our talks during Saturday and Sunday as well as free food and drinks. Buying
            a VIP ticket will give you access to the VIP Networking event where you can
            meet and network with other students interested in AI. There will also be
            a static exhibition of AI research and projects in the FAB lobby throughout
            the event.
