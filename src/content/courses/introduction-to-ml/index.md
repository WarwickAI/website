Hi Everyone!

Welcome to the **Introduction to Machine Learning Course**!

This is the first course we have hosted onto the website. Keep watching the [courses](https://warwick.ai/education/courses) as there will be more to come. 

We will be slowly adding to these courses; creating more exercises and adding more explanation over time. For now, you will recognise the two pages as the python notebooks from *Intro to Machine Learning* which we ran in-person in Term 1. If you missed it, don't worry! We will most likely run it again next year Term 1 so keep an eye on our socials for announcements.
