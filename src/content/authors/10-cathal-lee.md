    Hey everyone! My name is Cathal, and I’m excited to be this year’s summit coordinator. I’m currently a 3rd year maths student with a particular interest in audio signal processing especially in areas like emotion recognition using MFCC and Harmonics!  
    Fun fact: I have witnessed North Korean soldiers farming for an entire year.
