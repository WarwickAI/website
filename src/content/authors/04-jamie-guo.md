    Hi All! I’m Jamie, this year’s Treasurer and a 3rd year Maths student. I enjoy showing people how AI can enhance several aspects of everyday life, and I’m eager to support forward-thinking projects that put its possibilities on display.
    Fun fact: I once put the Secret Santa money on red in roulette, and (thankfully) won!
