    Hi, I’m Shaana, a first year Maths and Physics student and a fresher’s rep this year! I’m new to AI, but I’m excited to learn and to support the society in helping other beginners get involved. I’m especially interested in learning about the maths behind neural networks, and I’m looking forward to getting involved in some fun projects and meeting new people!
