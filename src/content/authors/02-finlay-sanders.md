    Hi all, I’m a first year CS student and excited to be your Head of Projects for the coming year!  I am interested in complexity (think Conway’s game of life) and machine learning. Stay tuned for some fun projects and competitions.
    Fun Fact: I also enjoy running, hiking, climbing and ultimate frisbee :)
