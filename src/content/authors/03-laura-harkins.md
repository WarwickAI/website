    Hi Everyone, I'm Laura, a 2nd Year PhD Student. My field of research is learning dynamics of neural networks and implicit bias of optimisers. If none of that made any sense to you (or if it did), come chat to me about it! I'm WAI's head of education this year, so you can find me at WAI's courses or codenights and quiz me on all things AI. I look forward to meeting you all!
