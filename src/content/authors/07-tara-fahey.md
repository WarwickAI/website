    Hey! I'm Tara, a 2nd year Discrete Maths student, and I'm your Projects Officer for 25/26! The drone project was what brought me to the society last year, and projects I feel is what makes this society what it is! AI-wise, I've mainly worked with OpenCV & visual processing, both with the drone project and my own climbing app. Hobby-wise, I climb too much, go to too many societies, speak French to myself, and am too emotionally attached to my bicycle :D
