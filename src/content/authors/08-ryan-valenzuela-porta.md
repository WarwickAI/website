bio: |
    Hi! I'm a third year CS Student and I'm excited to be your education officer this year! I'm interested in all areas of AI, but particularly interested in applied machine learning in edge computing (ask me about my third year project!). I've been a private tutor for 3 years and I'm passionate about explaining complex topics in a simple way, something I hope you'll be able to see in Warwick AI's courses this year. I also interned at Meta as a software engineer last summer, so I'm happy to give advice on tech careers too.
    Fun fact: I have a 1947 day streak on Duolingo (and counting!)
