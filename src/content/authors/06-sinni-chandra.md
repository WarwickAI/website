bio: |
    Hi! I’m Sinni, a 2nd year CS student and I’ll be your Engineer for 25/26! Along with managing the website and handling the technical side of the society, I’m happy to help out with any coding questions you may have. I’m particularly interested in the neural networks side of AI, and I think that the way machines can learn to recognize patterns and improve over time is fascinating. 
    Fun fact: I once managed to trip over flat ground, twice in the same day.
