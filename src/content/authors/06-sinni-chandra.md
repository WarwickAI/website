bio: 'Hi! I’m Sinni, a 2nd year CS student, and I’ll be your Engineer for 25/26! I’ll be managing our website and helping out with any tech-related queries or projects within the society. I'm particularly fascinated by how vast amounts of data can be processed so efficiently, it’s one of the reasons I love exploring machine learning and AI systems. As Engineer, I’ll also be supporting the team with our digital tools, demos, and any hands-on tech setups we run throughout the year.
Fun fact: I have an unhealthy obsession with Brooklyn Nine-Nine! I’ve rewatched it more times than I care to admit. Noice! Toit!'
