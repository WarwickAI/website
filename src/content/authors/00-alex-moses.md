    Hi, I’m Alex, a PhD student and tutor in Computer Science. This year I’m president of Warwick AI, and I previously led the Projects department. My research focuses on variational autoencoders. I'm also involved in the department research on the use of AI in higher education and have an interest in using diffusion models to create art (I will also run a workshop on creating AI art!!!).
