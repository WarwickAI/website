bio: |
    Hi everyone, I’m Sam, a second year Computer Science student from Coventry, and Warwick AI’s Vice President this year! Within AI, I’m mostly interested in how AI can be used with simulations to help solve problems in the natural sciences. Outside of AI, I enjoy climbing and can play the flute! Fun fact: I have a 1,200 day streak on Duolingo!
