bio: |
    Hi! Iâ€™m Gargi, a second-year CS student and Iâ€™ll be your Social and Welfare Sec for 25/26! As well as vamping up code night and running some really varied and inclusive socials, Iâ€™ll be on hand to discuss any concerns and welfare issues. Despite being relatively new to AI, I love engaging with fun technical projects that have tangible outcomes, but Iâ€™m more than happy to chat about anything from TV shows to sport.
    Fun fact: Iâ€™m an avid social runner and have a run a (slow) half-marathon! Iâ€™m also Secretary for Run Soc ðŸ™‚
