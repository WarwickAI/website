bio: |
    Hi! I’m Gargi, a first-year CS student and I’ll be your Social and Welfare Sec for 25/26! As well as vamping up code night and running some really varied and inclusive socials, I’ll be on hand to discuss any concerns and welfare issues. Despite being relatively new to AI, I love engaging with fun technical projects that have tangible outcomes, but I’m more than happy to chat about anything from TV shows to sport.
    Fun fact: I’m an avid social runner and have a run a (slow) half-marathon! I’m also Secretary for Run Soc 🙂
