We've redesigned our website for the next academic year, in hopes it will allow our members to easily find information about events and projects.

The new site also has vastly improved capabilities for building educational material, and we will also have competition leaderboards coming soon!

Let us know what you think on Discord, and if you have any ideas to further improve it! :)
